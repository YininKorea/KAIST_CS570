# KAIST_CS570
I implemented the basic framework and succeed experimenting it in CIFAR-10 in single-GPU setting.

You can change BN to GN by channging arugments in main.py and then compare both methods.

#To do:
## Add more dataloaders.
## Implemented the metrics which can be used to compare the distribution difference.
